# 📦 Supply Chain Management System – Machine Learning Based

## 🧾 Objective

The primary objective of this project is to optimize and forecast different components of supply chain management, such as **demand forecasting**, **inventory optimization**, and **supplier performance analysis**, using machine learning models.

---

## 🚀 Features – Key Functionalities

* 🔍 **Demand Forecasting**: Predict future demand using time-series and regression models.
* 📦 **Inventory Optimization**: Maintain optimal stock levels to reduce holding and shortage costs.
* 🛒 **Supplier Performance Evaluation**: Analyze and rank suppliers based on performance metrics.
* 📊 **Dashboard Visualization**: Interactive charts to track supply chain KPIs.
* ⚠️ **Risk Prediction**: Detect potential disruptions in the supply chain using classification techniques.

## ⚙️ How It Works – Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: Import datasets related to supply chain operations (sales, inventory, supplier logs).
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean, normalize, and engineer features for model readiness.
3. **Model Training**: Use different ML models for forecasting, classification, or clustering depending on the use case.
4. **Evaluation**: Use RMSE, MAE, accuracy, or F1-score to evaluate model performance.
5. **Visualization**: Display results in an intuitive dashboard.
6. **Prediction**: Allow user to input data and generate predictions or recommendations.

## 📥 Data Collection

* **Source**: [Kaggle Supply Chain Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prachi13/customer-analytics) and synthetic data generation.
* **Description**: Dataset includes order date, product type, inventory status, delivery performance, and supplier score.
* **Method**: Downloaded via Kaggle API and processed with Python scripts.

---

## 🎮 Controls (If Interactive)

* Input parameters for forecast (product ID, region, date range).
* Filter suppliers based on score threshold.
* Adjust inventory reorder thresholds.
* Real-time prediction through Streamlit form inputs.

---

## 🧠 ML Techniques Used

* **Linear Regression / Random Forest** – For demand prediction.
* **XGBoost Classifier** – For supply risk prediction.
* **K-Means Clustering** – For supplier segmentation.
* **Prophet** – For time-series forecasting.
* **PCA (Optional)** – For dimensionality reduction in high-dimensional datasets.

---

## 🏋️ Model Training

* **Train/Test Split**: 80/20
* **Cross-Validation**: 5-fold used for tuning hyperparameters.
* **Feature Importance**: Visualized using SHAP and feature importance plots.

---

## 📤 Output Explanation

* **Forecast Graphs**: Plots of predicted vs actual values.
* **Risk Alerts**: Binary label output showing “At Risk” or “Stable”.
* **Supplier Rank**: Normalized score from 0–100 based on performance indicators.
* **Inventory Health Score**: Computed as a combination of holding cost, shortage risk, and lead time.

---

## 🧾 Future Work

* Integrate with real-time APIs for continuous data.
* Add anomaly detection in logistics tracking.
* Deploy with Docker + FastAPI for production.
